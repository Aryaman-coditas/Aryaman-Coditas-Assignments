Assertion in Java-

Assertion in java is used to test your assumptions.You use assertion only
when you think that condition would logically never go wrong. It throws an error which is 
Assertion error. 

Difference between assertion and exception is that we use assertion when we think that the given condition would never go wrong.
But in case of exception, the thing might go wrong which might also depend upon the user inputs as well.
